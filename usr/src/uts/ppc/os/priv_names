	different from the process' effective uid.

file_owner
	Allows a process which is not the owner of a file or directory
	to perform the following operations that are normally permitted
	only for the file owner: modify that file's access and
	modification times; remove or rename a file or directory whose
	parent directory has the ``save text image after execution''
	(sticky) bit set; mount a ``namefs'' upon a file; modify
	permission bits or ACL except for the set-uid and set-gid

	a file without the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits being
	cleared.

	and the effective uid of the current process is not 0.

net_bindmlp
	Allow a process to bind to a port that is configured as a
	multi-level port(MLP) for the process's zone. This privilege
	applies to both shared address and zone-specific address MLPs.

	than those it can send signals to.  Processes which cannot
	be examined cannot be seen in /proc and appear not to exist.

proc_lock_memory
	Allows a process to lock pages in physical memory.

proc_owner
	Allows a process to send signals to other processes, inspect
	and modify process state to other processes regardless of
	ownership.  When modifying another process, additional
	restrictions apply:  the effective privilege set of the
	attaching process must be a superset of the target process'
	effective, permitted and inheritable sets; the limit set must
	be a superset of the target's limit set; if the target process
	has any uid set to 0 all privilege must be asserted unless the
	effective uid is 0.

	Allows a process to configure the audit parameters (cache and
	queue sizes, event to class mappings, policy options).

sys_config

	Allows a process to add and remove swap devices; when adding a swap
	device, a process must also have sufficient privileges to read from
	and write to the swap device.

sys_devices
	Allows a process to successfully call a kernel module that
	calls the kernel drv_priv(9F) function to check for allowed
	access.
	Allows a process to open the real console device directly.
	Allows a process to open devices that have been exclusively opened.

sys_ipc_config
	Allows a process to increase the size of a System V IPC Message
	Queue buffer.

sys_linkdir

sys_mount
	Allows filesystem specific administrative procedures, such as
	filesystem configuration ioctls, quota calls and creation/deletion
	of snapshots.
	Allows a process to mount and unmount filesystems which would
	otherwise be restricted (i.e., most filesystems except
	namefs).
	A process performing a mount operation needs to have
	appropriate access to the device being mounted (read-write for
	"rw" mounts, read for "ro" mounts).
	A process performing any of the aforementioned
	filesystem operations needs to have read/write/owner
	access to the mount point.
	Only regular files and directories can serve as mount points
	for processes which do not have all zone privileges asserted.
	Unless a process has all zone privileges, the mount(2)
	system call will force the "nosuid" and "restrict" options, the
	latter only for autofs mountpoints.
	Regardless of privileges, a process running in a non-global zone may
	only control mounts performed from within said zone.
	Outside the global zone, the "nodevices" option is always forced.

	has less than minfree space in reserve.

	that calls the kernel suser() function to check for allowed access.
	This privilege exists only for third party loadable module
	compatibility and is not used by Solaris proper.

	Allows a process to manipulate system time using any of the
	appropriate system calls: stime, adjtime, ntp_adjtime and
	the IA specific RTC calls.

	Allows a process to translate labels that are not dominated
	by the process' sensitivity label to and from an external
	string form.

	with Trusted Extensions.

win_devices
	Allows a process to perform operations on window input devices.
	Allows a process to get and set keyboard and pointer controls.

	label is not equal to the process sensitivity label.
	A newly created window property is created with the window's
